- Today's programming wisdom is to always prioritize code readability and maintainability. This means writing concise, well-structured, and easy-to-understand code that can be easily modified and expanded upon as needed. To achieve this, follow these best practices:

1. Use clear variable and function names that describe their purpose and usage.
2. Organize code into logical blocks and sections, using the appropriate data structures (e.g. arrays, objects, hashes). 
3. Comment your code, explaining its purpose, functionality, input, output, edge cases, etc., to make it easier for others to understand and contribute to your work.  
4. Follow coding conventions and standards in your chosen programming language and framework. These conventions can vary, but common practices include using appropriate whitespace, indentation, brackets, semicolons, parentheses, curly braces, commas, et cetera. Following conventions makes code easier to read and understand.   
5. Write modular code by breaking larger problems into smaller, reusable functions and classes. Not only does this make code more manageable, it also allows for easier collaboration and reuse.    
6. Refactor and optimize code regularly to remove unnecessary complexity and improve performance. While writing code is often a trade-off between readibility and efficiency, refactoring can help achieve a balance between the two.     
7. Learn and use version control systems like Git to manage code and track changes. Version control allows you to easily revert to previous versions of your project, collaborate with others, track bugs and feature requests, as well as maintain a clear history of code changes for future reference.       
8. Continuously learn and keep up with new programming languages, frameworks, tools, libraries, best-practices, security vulnerabilities, performance optimizations, code review techniques, testing methodologies, debugging strategies, project management tools and more. The more you know, the better you can write, maintain, expand, troubleshoot, improve, refine, optimize, secure, test, deploy, monitor, update, archive, back up, document, organize, share, communicate, learn, teach, lead, manage, mentor, support, build, ship, release, retire, or otherwise support software.
